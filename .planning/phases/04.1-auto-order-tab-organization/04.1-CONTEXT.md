# Phase 4.1: Auto Order Tab Organization - Context

**Gathered:** 2026-01-19
**Status:** Ready for planning

<domain>
## Phase Boundary

Reorganize extension hub content under a new `auto_order.read` permission. Move auto-ordering UI (stats, task, queue, actions) into a dedicated Auto Order tab. Establish persistent sections (profile, agent info) that display across all tabs. This is a layout/permission refactor — no new features, just reorganization of existing content.

## Implementation Decisions

### Layout Order (top to bottom)
- Tab bar at the top (already implemented in Phase 4)
- Profile section below tabs: user name, type badge, admin badge, Clock Out button
- Agent/Account info section: Label, Account, Role
- Tab content area: displays content for active tab

### Content Mapping — What Moves to Auto Order Tab
The following current hub elements become Auto Order tab content ONLY:
- Stats section (Active, Queued, Attention counts)
- Current Task section (type, elapsed, stage, controls)
- Attention Items section ("Needs Attention" list)
- Queue section (queued tasks list)
- Quick Actions section (Start, Pause All, Emergency Stop, + Fake Task)
- Hotkeys section (Ctrl+Shift+P, Ctrl+Shift+X)

### Content Mapping — What Stays Persistent (visible on all tabs)
- Tab bar (already persistent)
- Profile section (user name, type badge, admin badge, Clock Out)
- Agent/Account info section (Label, Account, Role)

### Permission Integration
- New permission: `auto_order.read` in "Ordering Permissions" category
- VA with `auto_order.read` assigned sees "Auto Order" tab
- Admin bypass continues to show all tabs (including Auto Order)
- Tab renders based on role permissions like existing RBAC

### Claude's Discretion
- Exact styling adjustments for relocated sections
- How to handle the profile section layout change (current is horizontal with Clock Out on right)
- Whether to add visual separators between persistent sections and tab content

</decisions>

<specifics>
## Specific Ideas

- Profile section moves from above tabs to below tabs — establishes "Tabs → Profile → Agent → Content" hierarchy
- Hotkeys section only shown in Auto Order tab (not persistent) since those actions are auto-order specific
- Agent info remains visible so users always know which account/agent context they're working in

</specifics>

<deferred>
## Deferred Ideas

None — discussion stayed within phase scope
