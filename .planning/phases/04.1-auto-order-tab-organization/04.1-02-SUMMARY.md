# Phase 4.1 Plan 02: Hub Layout Reorganization Summary

**Extension hub restructured with tabs at top, persistent profile/agent sections, and Auto Order content as tab-specific container**

## Performance

- **Duration:** 2 min
- **Started:** 2026-01-19T17:37:02Z
- **Completed:** 2026-01-19T17:39:16Z
- **Tasks:** 3
- **Files modified:** 3

## Accomplishments

- Hub layout reorganized: tab bar at top, profile section below, agent info below that
- Auto Order tab added as first tab for admins with robot emoji icon
- All automation controls (stats, task, attention, queue, actions, hotkeys) wrapped in auto-order-content container
- Tab switching shows Auto Order controls or placeholder depending on selected tab

## Task Commits

Each task was committed atomically:

1. **Task 1: Reorganize HTML layout** - `08758f8` (feat)
2. **Task 2: Update JavaScript for tab switching** - `786ef84` (feat)
3. **Task 3: Add CSS for auto-order-content** - `1b857db` (feat)

## Files Created/Modified

- `packages/extension/sidepanel.html` - Reorganized hub section layout with auto-order-content wrapper
- `packages/extension/sidepanel.js` - Added Auto Order to ADMIN_TABS, updated showTabContent for content switching
- `packages/extension/sidepanel.css` - Added auto-order-content flex container styles

## Decisions Made

- Auto Order tab appears first in admin tabs (reflects priority of automation features)
- Profile and agent info sections remain visible regardless of active tab (user always sees identity context)
- Tab content placeholder is hidden by default, only shown when non-Auto-Order tabs are selected

## Deviations from Plan

None - plan executed exactly as written.

## Issues Encountered

None

## User Setup Required

None - no external service configuration required.

## Next Phase Readiness

- Auto Order tab now displays automation controls when selected
- Other tabs show placeholder text
- Ready for Plan 03: Hotkeys and tab navigation enhancements
