# Phase 28.1: V4 Tech Debt Cleanup Verification Report

**Phase Goal:** Address 4 non-blocking tech debt items from v4 milestone audit: naming inconsistency, orphaned pages, dead exports, unused skeleton
**Verified:** 2026-01-27T23:10:00Z
**Status:** PASSED
**Re-verification:** No -- initial verification

## Goal Achievement

### Observable Truths

| # | Truth | Status | Evidence |
|---|-------|--------|----------|
| 1 | Breadcrumb for /admin/automation displays "Automation Hub" matching the PageHeader title | VERIFIED | `breadcrumb-nav.tsx` line 22: `automation: "Automation Hub"`, `automation/page.tsx` line 71: `title="Automation Hub"`, `navigation.ts` line 34: `label: "Automation Hub"` -- all three match |
| 2 | No route exists for /admin/department-roles or /admin/invites (404 or redirect) | VERIFIED | Both directories deleted: `apps/web/src/app/admin/department-roles/` and `apps/web/src/app/admin/invites/` return "No such file or directory". Breadcrumb labels for these routes also removed. |
| 3 | No dead exports remain in lib/spacing.ts, lib/navigation.ts, or skeletons/ | VERIFIED | `spacing.ts` deleted (confirmed missing). `card-grid-skeleton.tsx` deleted (confirmed missing). `navigation.ts` has 5 exports (`dashboardNavItem`, `adminSidebarSections`, `vaSidebarSections`, `clientSidebarSections`, `getVisibleSections`) -- all 5 are imported and used in layout files and `app-sidebar.tsx`. No deprecated flat exports remain. Zero grep hits for `adminNavItems`, `vaNavItems`, `clientNavItems`, `SPACING`, `GAPS`, `SpacingKey`, `GapKey`, or `CardGridSkeleton` across all `.ts`/`.tsx` files. |
| 4 | Application compiles with zero TypeScript errors after all removals | VERIFIED | `npx tsc --noEmit` returned zero output (no errors). No dangling imports of deleted files found anywhere in `apps/web/src`. |

**Score:** 4/4 truths verified

### Required Artifacts

| Artifact | Expected | Status | Details |
|----------|----------|--------|---------|
| `apps/web/src/components/layout/breadcrumb-nav.tsx` | Corrected breadcrumb label for automation segment | VERIFIED | 79 lines, substantive, exported, imported by 3 layout files (admin, va, client), `automation: "Automation Hub"` present on line 22 |
| `apps/web/src/lib/navigation.ts` | Clean navigation config without deprecated flat exports | VERIFIED | 69 lines, substantive, 5 exports all actively used, zero deprecated/dead exports, zero TODO/FIXME markers |
| `apps/web/src/lib/spacing.ts` | Deleted (dead code) | VERIFIED | File does not exist, zero imports found |
| `apps/web/src/components/skeletons/card-grid-skeleton.tsx` | Deleted (unused skeleton) | VERIFIED | File does not exist, zero imports found. Remaining skeletons (`dashboard-skeleton.tsx`, `table-skeleton.tsx`) still actively used. |
| `apps/web/src/app/admin/department-roles/page.tsx` | Deleted (orphaned page) | VERIFIED | File and directory do not exist |
| `apps/web/src/app/admin/invites/page.tsx` | Deleted (orphaned page) | VERIFIED | File and directory do not exist |

### Key Link Verification

| From | To | Via | Status | Details |
|------|----|-----|--------|---------|
| `breadcrumb-nav.tsx` | `automation/page.tsx` | segmentLabels mapping + PageHeader title | VERIFIED | Both use "Automation Hub" -- breadcrumb maps `automation` segment to "Automation Hub", PageHeader renders `title="Automation Hub"` |
| `navigation.ts` | `automation/page.tsx` | sidebar section label | VERIFIED | Sidebar section `id: "automation"` has `label: "Automation Hub"`, consistent with breadcrumb and PageHeader |
| `navigation.ts` | `admin/layout.tsx` | import of `adminSidebarSections` | VERIFIED | `admin/layout.tsx` imports and passes `adminSidebarSections` to sidebar component |
| `navigation.ts` | `app-sidebar.tsx` | import of `dashboardNavItem`, `getVisibleSections` | VERIFIED | Both imported and called in render logic |

### Requirements Coverage

No formal requirements mapped to phase 28.1 in REQUIREMENTS.md. This phase addresses tech debt items identified in the v4 milestone audit.

### Anti-Patterns Found

| File | Line | Pattern | Severity | Impact |
|------|------|---------|----------|--------|
| (none) | -- | -- | -- | No anti-patterns found in modified files |

### Human Verification Required

### 1. Visual breadcrumb check
**Test:** Navigate to /admin/automation and check the breadcrumb trail
**Expected:** Breadcrumb shows "Admin > Automation Hub" (not "Admin > Collection")
**Why human:** Visual rendering cannot be verified programmatically

### 2. 404 behavior for deleted routes
**Test:** Navigate to /admin/department-roles and /admin/invites
**Expected:** Both return Next.js 404 page (not found)
**Why human:** Runtime routing behavior requires a running dev server

### 3. Modal functionality preserved
**Test:** On /admin/users page, click "Access Profiles" and "Manage Invites" buttons
**Expected:** Both modals open with full content (components were NOT deleted, only standalone pages were)
**Why human:** Component rendering and modal behavior require runtime testing

### Gaps Summary

No gaps found. All 4 tech debt items are fully resolved:
1. Naming inconsistency fixed -- "Automation Hub" is now consistent across breadcrumb, sidebar section label, and PageHeader
2. Orphaned pages deleted -- /admin/department-roles and /admin/invites routes no longer exist
3. Dead exports removed -- spacing.ts deleted, card-grid-skeleton.tsx deleted, deprecated flat nav exports removed from navigation.ts
4. TypeScript compiles cleanly with zero errors after all removals
