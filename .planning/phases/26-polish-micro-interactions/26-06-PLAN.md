<objective>
Verify all Phase 26 Polish & Micro-interactions features work correctly across all themes and user roles.

Purpose: Final quality gate before completing the v4 UI/Design System milestone. Ensures all 10 POLISH requirements are implemented and the application feels polished, responsive, and professional.

Output: Verified feature checklist confirming all POLISH items pass.

  <what-built>
Complete Phase 26 Polish & Micro-interactions implementation:

**POLISH-01: Sidebar nav transitions** — Nav items have hover/active transitions via existing SidebarMenuButton styles (150ms ease built into shadcn/ui sidebar component).

**POLISH-02: Card hover elevation** — Cards have `transition-shadow hover:shadow-md` for subtle shadow increase on hover.

**POLISH-03: Button press feedback** — All buttons have `active:scale-[0.98]` for tactile press feedback.

**POLISH-04: Page transitions** — View Transitions API (Phase 23) handles route changes. Content fade-in via `animate-fade-in` CSS class for data loading.

**POLISH-05: Dialog/modal animations** — shadcn/ui Dialog already has scale + fade animations (`animate-in/animate-out`, `zoom-in-95/zoom-out-95`, `fade-in-0/fade-out-0`). CommandDialog uses the same.

**POLISH-06: Skeleton loading states** — Shimmer-animated skeletons for dashboard, table, and card grid layouts. Existing SkeletonRow upgraded from pulse to shimmer.

**POLISH-07: Empty state designs** — Four contextual variants (no-results, first-time, error, filtered) with inline SVG illustrations and optional CTA buttons.

**POLISH-08: Focus ring consistency** — Buttons use `focus-visible:border-ring focus-visible:ring-ring/50 focus-visible:ring-[3px]` consistently. All interactive elements inherit the ring styles from shadcn/ui components.

**POLISH-09: Command palette** — Cmd+K opens CommandPalette with navigation pages, quick actions, fuzzy search. Role-based filtering for Admin/VA/Client.

**POLISH-10: Keyboard shortcuts** — Vim-style G+key navigation sequences, ? for shortcuts reference modal, all registered via react-hotkeys-hook.

  <how-to-verify>
Start the dev server: `cd apps/web && npm run dev`

**1. Micro-interactions (all themes):**
Switch to each theme (Midnight, Dawn, Slate, Carbon) and verify:
- [ ] Hover over a Card component — shadow subtly increases
- [ ] Click and hold a Button — it scales down slightly (0.98)
- [ ] Sidebar nav items have smooth hover transitions
- [ ] Release button — it springs back to normal size

**2. Skeleton Loading:**
- [ ] Check that skeleton components exist in `src/components/skeletons/`
- [ ] If any page loading is visible, verify shimmer animation (gradient sweep, not opacity pulse)
- [ ] Open DevTools -> Rendering -> check "prefers-reduced-motion: reduce" -> shimmer stops, shows static muted background

**3. Empty States:**
- [ ] Check that empty state components exist in `src/components/empty-states/`
- [ ] Components render: title text, description text, inline SVG illustration
- [ ] SVG illustrations adapt to current theme colors (use currentColor)

**4. Command Palette (Cmd+K):**
- [ ] Press Cmd+K (Mac) or Ctrl+K (Windows) — command palette opens
- [ ] Type "dashboard" — Dashboard item appears in results
- [ ] Type "order" — Order Tracking appears (keyword match)
- [ ] Press Enter on a navigation item — navigates to that page and palette closes
- [ ] Select "Toggle Sidebar" action — sidebar expands/collapses
- [ ] Select "Profile Settings" action — settings dialog opens
- [ ] Press Escape — palette closes

**5. Keyboard Shortcuts:**
- [ ] Press G then D — navigates to Dashboard
- [ ] Press G then B — navigates to Order Tracking
- [ ] Press G then A — navigates to Accounts
- [ ] Press ? — Shortcuts Reference modal opens
- [ ] Shortcuts Reference shows all groups (Navigation, Actions, Command Palette) with Kbd badges
- [ ] Click in a text input and type G D — NO navigation occurs (shortcuts disabled in inputs)

**6. Cross-theme Verification:**
- [ ] Switch through all 4 themes — command palette renders correctly in each
- [ ] Kbd badges in shortcuts reference are readable in all themes
- [ ] Empty state SVGs are visible (not invisible) in all themes

**7. Reduced Motion:**
- [ ] In DevTools -> Rendering -> enable "prefers-reduced-motion: reduce"
- [ ] Verify: skeleton shimmer stops, button transitions are instant, content appears without fade
