## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

See PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.

Phase 23 decisions:
- Used oklch() color space consistently across all 4 theme presets
- True #000000 black in Carbon theme for OLED battery savings with near-white text (oklch 0.97) to reduce halation
- Hardcoded hex preview colors in theme metadata for preview cards (not CSS variables)
- View Transitions API with progressive enhancement (instant fallback on unsupported browsers)
- SystemThemeMapper manipulates DOM attributes directly (not setTheme) to preserve "system" in localStorage
- Each theme has unique accent hue: Midnight=blue(250), Dawn=indigo(264), Slate=teal(175), Carbon=purple(300)

### Pending Todos

None.

### Blockers/Concerns

**v4 constraint:** Performance-neutral minimum, performance-positive preferred. All UI changes must use CSS-first approach to avoid compute overhead.
**v4 constraint:** Theme switching must trigger ZERO React re-renders -- CSS variable cascade only.
**v4 constraint:** No CSS-in-JS, no JS scrollbar libraries. Scrollbar styling must be CSS-only to preserve react-window virtualization.
